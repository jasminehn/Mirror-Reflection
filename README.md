_Mirror Reflection_ is a 2D puzzle-platformer where the player must progress through dual realities with their reflection. Your reflection is your mirror image, it does exactly what you do, except it's reflected across the x-axis. What sets you apart is that your worlds are different. While an area in your world may not have any obstacles, your reflection may encounter an enemy in that same place. The objective of the game is to avoid obstacles in both worlds so that both you and your reflection can survive through the level. 

### Concept
